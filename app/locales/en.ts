    subtitle:
      "The two powerful pillars of the Pelasgian bridge that connect the Indo-European space",
    body: `
<p>Enter a world where Indo-European culture resembles a river that originates in ancient antiquity and, traversing countless centuries, has gathered along its historical journey numerous crystal-clear streams. Today, these have transformed it into a vast river of cultural wealth—a great river from which we can fish out values from humanity's embryonic history as well as cultural treasures created throughout humanity's historical journey, including the values we possess today.</p>
<p>This collection of books presented in this window, aiming to explore the ancient history of two nations and the culture created by them—two nations that have withstood the storms and tempests of time—is nothing more than a compilation of observations made during a journey along a segment of the Indo-European cultural river. This specific segment flows along the shores of Armenian and Albanian culture. It is a journey in search of the bridge that once connected these two shores, across which our ancient Pelasgian ancestor freely moved from one side to the other.</p>
<p>Your company would make this journey even more enjoyable!</p>
<p>We invite you to be part of it!</p>
